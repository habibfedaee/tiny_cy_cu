I switched my project to (www.demoblaze.com) in order to be bugg-free and move on quickly. 

tasks: 
- create page objects and locators for each pages inside (demoblaze.com) --> 50 percent done
- update the test
- create custom commands in /support/commands.js:
    - login                     done    
    - add to cart               done
    - checkout                  in progress
    - checkout success          pending
    - checkout failure          pending
    - go to home                pending
    - go to cart                pending
