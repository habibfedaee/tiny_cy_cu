this configuration and setup works
note everything in this framework and create step by step guide for later use.

proceed and create page object model for the website and create end to end testing and api

create different scenarios for each test as much as possible:
    - positive
    - negative
    - boundry testing
    - cross browser testing (not applicable using cypress i think)
    -

Login page scenarios:
    1. valid login credentials:
        - test case 1: verify that a user can login with a valid username and password
    2. invalid login credentials:
        - test case 2: verify that a user with invalid username and/or password cannot login and receives an appropriate error message
    3. Login Page UI elements:
        - test case 3: ensure that all UI elements inside login page are displayed properly and have the expected behavior
    4. Password masking:
        - test case 4: confirm that the password is masked while typing the password in the password field.
    5. Remember me functionality:
        - test case 5: verify that remember me checkbox function when selected retains user login information across different sessions.
    
Product Page List scenarios:
    1. Product listing:
        - test case 6: check that all available products are displayed correctly with their names, prices, and images.
    2. Product sorting:
        - test case 7: verify that user can sort products by name and process in (ascending/descending) order.
    3. Product filtering:
        - test case 8: verify that users can filter products by category or other relevant criteria.

Add to cart functionality scenarios:
    1. Add product to cart:
        - test case 9: ensure that users can add products to the cart and cart counts update accordingly.
    2. Cart icon and counter:
        - test case 10: verify that cart icon and counter actually matches with the number of product added to the cart.

Cart page test scenarios:
    1. Cart contents:
        - test case 11: check that cart displays the correct products with their names, prices, and quantities.
    2. Remove items from cart:
        - test case 12: ensure that the users can remove items from the cart and counter updates accordingly.

Checkout process scenarios:
    1. Proceed to checkout:
        - test case 13: confirm that user can move from cart page to the checkout page.
    2. Billing information:
        - test case 14: verify that users can enter and update billing information correctly. 
    3. Shipping information:
        - test case 15: ensure that users can enter and update shipping information corrrectly.
    4. Payment processing:
        - test case 16: test the payment process by valid and invalid information to ensure it works as expected.
    5. Order confirmation:
        - test case 17: verify that users can receive their order confirmation after completing the checkout process.

General Test scenarios:
    1. Crosss-browser compatibility:
        - test case 18: test the website using different internet browsers (chrome, firefox, safari, edge) to ensure its compatibility.
    2. Mobile responsiveness:
        - test case 19: verify that the website functions and appears properly in multiple mobile devices
    3. Error handling:
        - test case 20: test the website's error handling capability by entering incorrect data and ensure that the appropriate error messages are displayed.
    4. Security testing:
        - test case 21: check for security vulnerabilities (sql injections, XSS, data protection).
    5. Performance testing:
        - test case 22: test the website's performance by using higher user loads and monitoring response times.
    6. Logout functionality:
        - test case 23: verify that the users can log out of their accounts and are redirected to the login page.

1. SQL Injection Testing:

SQL injection is a common security vulnerability where malicious SQL queries are injected into input fields to access or manipulate a database improperly.
To test for SQL injection in Cypress:

Attempt to enter SQL injection payloads into input fields and verify that the application rejects or sanitizes them properly.
Verify that the application does not display sensitive database error messages to users.

2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Testing:

XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
To test for XSS in Cypress:

Attempt to inject XSS payloads (e.g., <script>alert('XSS')</script>) into input fields, and ensure that the application escapes or sanitizes user input to prevent script execution.
Verify that the application does not reflect user-input directly onto web pages without proper encoding.

3. Authentication and Authorization Testing:

Test the authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that users can only access the parts of the application they are authorized to access.
In Cypress:

Create test cases for different user roles (e.g., regular user, admin) and verify that each user can access only their allowed resources.
Attempt to access restricted pages without proper authorization and ensure they are denied access.

4. Session Management Testing:

Test the handling of user sessions and ensure that session-related vulnerabilities (e.g., session fixation, session hijacking) are mitigated.
In Cypress:

Log in as a user and verify that the session is created and managed correctly.
Test session expiration and ensure that users are prompted to reauthenticate after the session times out.

5. Input Validation Testing:

Test how the application handles various inputs, including boundary values and malicious input.
In Cypress:

Send valid inputs to input fields and ensure they are accepted.
Send invalid or unexpected inputs and verify that the application handles them gracefully without crashing or revealing sensitive information.

6. Data Encryption Testing:

Ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, is transmitted securely over HTTPS.
In Cypress:

Check that the application enforces HTTPS for sensitive transactions.
Monitor network requests to ensure that sensitive data is not sent over unencrypted connections.

7. Error Handling Testing:

Test how the application handles errors, such as 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error) responses.
In Cypress:

Send requests to non-existent URLs and verify that the application displays a user-friendly error page.
Test for error messages that might leak sensitive information.

8. Vulnerability Scanning and Penetration Testing:

Consider using specialized security tools and services to perform automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
Cypress is primarily a testing framework, so for comprehensive security testing, you may want to integrate it with security-specific tools or services, such as OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or specialized security testing libraries like cypress-axe for accessibility testing.

Remember that security testing is an ongoing process, and it's essential to stay updated with security best practices and vulnerabilities to keep your application secure.
